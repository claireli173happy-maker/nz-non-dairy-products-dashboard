# nz-non-dairy-products-dashboard

## Project Overview

This project analyses the registration data of **non-dairy cleaning and sanitising products in New Zealand**, with a focus on:

- Overall registration scale  
- Company distribution (Top 10 by product count)  
- Product type composition (Top 10 product categories)  
- Product expiry risk and regulatory exposure  

The analysis demonstrates end-to-end data analytics skills, from data exploration and validation using SQL to insight communication through an interactive Tableau dashboard.  

For clarity and readability, the dashboard highlights **Top 10 companies and product types**, enabling clear comparison while preserving the overall distribution patterns.


## Data Source
- Public registration data from **New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI)**
- Dataset includes registered non-dairy cleaning and sanitising products, their manufacturers, product types, approval dates, and expiry dates

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (PostgreSQL syntax)** – data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis
- **Microsoft Excel** – intermediate data export
- **Tableau** – dashboard design and visualisation
- **GitHub** – project documentation and portfolio presentation

The following questions were explored in this project:

- How many non-dairy products and companies are currently registered?
- Which companies hold the highest number of registered products?
- What are the most common product types?
- How are products distributed by expiry risk (expired, expiring soon, long-term valid)?
- Which products require near-term regulatory attention due to upcoming expiry?
